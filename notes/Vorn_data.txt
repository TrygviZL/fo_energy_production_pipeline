#Vorn Data
A .csv file of the current view can be downloaded from vedrid.fo/archive. We note 
that weather station and time interval can be chosen. 
Downloading the .csv file shows that the file is semicolon (;) delimited and has around
65 columns including the 'DateTime' column which logs the values at a 1 minute interval.
The naming of each column does not directly indicate which measure it represents. 
By downloading the data for each graph individually, we found the following:
________________________
Column   |   Description

WS       |   Wind Speed
WD       |   Wind Direction
TAAVG1M  |   Temperature avg 1m

The sun data does not seem to exist in the overall data download. Thus we will
create logic which uses the button next to the sun graph to extract only 
that data. Othweise, all needed data is included in the large dataset.
